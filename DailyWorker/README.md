# Daily Worker Project by Koshir0
This project like a database but for worker such as bricklayer, laborers
who work in the construction industry help the seeker to find them in one place 
also, you help the seeker to rent tools for worker and leasing their tools

The first page tells the user about the project, they can register as a worker or seeker when they log in,  they see two options shows up if they are a laborer they can update their information or if they are seekers they can rent tools or search for workers
worker page to update their information
seeker page shows the laborers in our database 
rent page let them  rent tools or leasing their tools 
when clicking on more details for any tool they can reserve the tool for about one day up to a month.

I believe my project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements because of the idea of helping laborers who work daily 
I used three models, Django framework in backend and javascript in front-end and make it mobile responsive
I hope you all like it
